# lab6 by Andrew
In this lab, I used both software and hardware methods to access a bit specific address of TM4C123GH6PM LaunchPad board.
Why using both methods? the reason being is that I wanted to know if it affects the system delay function due coding methods. 
I also created a couple functions to read the values of PORTF's data and direction status.
